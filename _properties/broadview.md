description: 'Located just blocks from John’s Hopkins University, Broadview mixes classical urban architecture with updated amenities to create the ultimate student living experience.  The coffee is always brewing in our 24 hour internet cafe, perfect for 8AM classes or an all-nighter before final exams.  Skip the library and kick back in one of our two study lounges complete with a fireplace and ping-pong tables to help you relax or burn off some steam when you have a paper due the next day.  Group projects are a breeze with our collaborative work spaces, where you can connect to our Chromecast and your classmates while you get the job done.  From bike storage to an onsite theater to a fully equipped fitness center, Broadview is more than student living…it’s student life!'
