        <h2 class='text-center editable'>Empowered Partnerships</h2>
        <p class="editable">Everyone needs a good wingman. The best partnerships have that indefinable characteristic. It’s pure magic. It’s perfect chemistry.</p>
        <p class="editable">In 1999, building on his family’s 40+ years of multifamily experience, Dwight Dunton III started Bonaventure Realty Group in the spare bedroom of his rented apartment. Bonaventure was built around a unique concept - success isn’t as much about the properties as it is about the people. With a great property and average people, you still get average results; but, if you have great people you can consistently beat the market.  At the time, Dwight had more fingers on his right hand than he did employees.  Since then, Dwight’s innovative people strategy has helped Bonaventure become one of the preeminent boutique management and development firms in the Mid-Atlantic Region.</p>
        <p class="editable">Whether you&rsquo;re a resident, investor or property owner, we see you as a partner. As your wingman, we bring financial wisdom, street smarts and contagious enthusiasm to the team. With nearly 50 years of experience creating highly selective investment opportunities, nimbly managing multifamily assets and setting the highest standards for resident satisfaction, when you partner with us, you can rest assured that we&rsquo;ll always have your back. You won&rsquo;t simply feel empowered, you&rsquo;ll feel empartnered.</p>
